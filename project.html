        <h3>Team: Arun Chary Gattoji, Suprith Son Dubba</h3>
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            The LSTM Text Generation Tool is an innovative project focused on developing an 
            LSTM-based algorithm that can produce coherent and contextually relevant text sequences 
            based on user-provided keywords. Leveraging the power of deep learning, this tool will 
            enable applications spanning content generation, creative writing, and research 
            augmentation. Users will input a single word or phrase, serving as the foundation 
            for generating meaningful text. With its versatility and potential for integration, 
            the LSTM Text Generation Tool aims to become an indispensable asset for those seeking 
            high-quality text generation across various domains.
